Minor (M)VC PHP Framework

Current main reason for developing this is to learn more about the MVC structure with PHP.


TODO:
	Add some sort of layout system for static parts of pages
    Add functions to empty classes
    Add functionality to uploadFiles() in the upload class
    Add better functionality to the query class (hint: inner joins, longer queries)
    
    - Header()!

Notes:
    Make resizeimage into an complete image class instead
